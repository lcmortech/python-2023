# QUICKSORT ALGORITHM (Programiz)

# Quicksort is a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer approach where

# An array is divided into subarrays by selecting a pivot element (element selected from the array).

# While dividing the array, the pivot element should be positioned in such a way that elements less than pivot are kept on the left side and elements greater than pivot are on the right side of the pivot.
# The left and right subarrays are also divided using the same approach. This process continues until each subarray contains a single element.
# At this point, elements are already sorted. Finally, elements are combined to form a sorted array.

# Working of Quicksort Algorithm

# 1. Select the Pivot Element
# There are different variations of quicksort where the pivot element is selected from different positions. Here, we will be selecting the rightmost element of the array as the pivot element.
