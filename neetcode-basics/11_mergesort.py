# Merge Sort is one of the most popular sorting algorithms that is based on the principle of Divide and Conquer Algorithm.

# Using merge sort, a problem is divided into multiple sub-problems. Each sub-problem is solved individually. Finally, sub-problems are combined to form the final solution.

# THE DIVIDE AND CONQUER TECHNIQUE

# Using the Divide and Conquer technique, we divide a problem into subproblems. When the solution to each subproblem is ready, we 'combine' the results from the subproblems to solve the main problem.

# EXAMPLE

# Suppose we had to sort an array A. A subproblem would be to sort a sub-section of this array starting at index p and ending at index r, denoted as A[p..r].

# DIVIDE

# If q is the half-way point between p and r, then we can split the subarray A[p..r] into two arrays A[p..q] and A[q+1, r].
