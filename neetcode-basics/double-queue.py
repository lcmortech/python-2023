# Methods needed:
# push_back
# pop_back
# pop_front
# get_back
# get_front
# empty

# Alternatively: Python has a built in double queue method: deque()

# from collections import deque

# my_deque = deque()

#class Node:
    #def __init__(self, val):
       # self.val = val
       # self.next = next

#class Dequeue:


    #def __init__(self):
       # self.head = self.tail = None
