# Design a Graph Data Structure

# General Notes About Graphs (BFS and DFS)

# A data structure that is a collection of nodes containing data and are connected to other nodes (not unlike a linked list)

# On Facebook, everything is a node. That includes User, Photo, Album, Event, Group, Page, Comment, Story, Video, Link, Note...anything that has data is a node.

# Every relationship is an edge from one node to another. Whether you post a photo, join a group, like a page, etc., a new edge is created for that relationship.
