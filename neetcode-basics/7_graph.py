# Design a Graph Data Structure

# General Notes About Graphs (BFS and DFS)

# A data structure that is a collection of nodes containing data and are connected to other nodes (not unlike a linked list)

# On Facebook, everything is a node. That includes User, Photo, Album, Event, Group, Page, Comment, Story, Video, Link, Note...anything that has data is a node.

# Every relationship is an edge from one node to another. Whether you post a photo, join a group, like a page, etc., a new edge is created for that relationship. All of facebook is then a collection of these nodes and edges. This is because facebook uses a graph data structure to store its data.

# More precisely, a graph is a data structure (V,E) that consists of:
# A collection of vertices (V)
# A collection of edges (E), represented as ordered pairs of vertices
# (U,V)

# V = {0, 1, 2, 3}
# E = {{0,1}, {0,2}, {1,2}}
# G = {V, E}
