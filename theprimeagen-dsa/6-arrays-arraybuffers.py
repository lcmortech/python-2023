## NOTES

# The diff between an array/list they don't use 0 as heasd or length as tail, like an array list. You can have an index-based head and an index-based tail
# Just add +1 to the head or tail, which makes them O(1) operations
# You can also use the modulo operato this.tail % len (typescript) gives you your index into the array
# Acts as a ring buffer
