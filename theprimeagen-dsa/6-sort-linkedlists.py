## NOTES

# So what sucks about an array?
# Deletion - can't delete but copy
# Can't insert but can write
# It's ungrowable

# LINKED LISTS
# Our first node-based data structure
# The node consists of an item/value and a pointer(next) that points to the next node
# the pointer contains a reference to another value or another node
