## NOTES

# This is probably the most common data structure that I have implemented in many languages.
# FIFO - First In First Out (like waiting in line)
# To the whote board!
# We use a singly linked list, we don't need  a doubly linked list

# Runtime O(1) operations
# enqueue
# dequeue
# peek

# We're entering a world of DSA where constraints make things fast
# You will notice pretty much everything from here on out that what makes a lot of these data structures fast is the lack of features.
