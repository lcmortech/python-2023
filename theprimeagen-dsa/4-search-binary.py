## NOTES

# This second algorithm is a bit pof a doosy, but its definitely a basis for other algorithms we will encounter.
# An important question you should always ask for your dataset: Is it ordered? If it is, there are new advantages you can take with that data
# Lets say it this time. So how can we search this array?
# First, let's come up with the algorithm together
# The worst case scenario is when the value's not in the array and you will halve it over and over again until the end.
