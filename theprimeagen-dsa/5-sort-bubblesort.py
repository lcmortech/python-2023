## NOTES

# Yes, let's do bubble sort. Usually the first algorithm in almost every major source is insertion sort, but I find it so boring. Let's do bubble sort!
# As my teacher once said...to the whiteboard!
# Any x sub-i/ith poisiton in the array is going to be less than or equal to any i+1
# starts in 0-eth position (first position) its gonna go to the end of the array. It goes to the +1 next to it and asks, if I'm larger than you, let's swap positions.
# A singular iteration will always produce the largest item in the last spot/position. We can go up to, but not include the last position
