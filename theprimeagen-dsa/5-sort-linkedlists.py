## NOTES

# So what sucks about an array?
# Deletion - can't delete but copy
# Can't insert but can write
# It's ungrowable

# LINKED LISTS
# Our first node-based data structure
# The node consists of an item/value and a pointer(next) that points to the next node
# the pointer contains a reference to another value or another node

## Let's talk time/space complexity
# prepend/append O(1)
# insertion in the middle
# deletion from the ends O(1)
# deletion in the middle O(n)
# get head/tail - O(1)
# get in general O(1)
# I recommend not traversing an n-length algorithm with a linked list
