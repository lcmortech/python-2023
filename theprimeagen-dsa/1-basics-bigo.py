## NOTES

# We use insertion sort for smaller subsets of data bc while its slower, being O(n^2), its faster than say quicksort which is O(logn), because the n is sufficiently small enough for the constant being dropped makes more of an impact

# IMPORTANT CONCEPTS
# Growth is with respect to the input
# Constants are dropped
# Big O is the "Upper Bound"
# Worst case is usually the way we measure
# base 2 log = O(log n) (log2base2 ?)

# Fav algo is quicksort (ring buffer, or an array list if you dont need a fifo behavior)
