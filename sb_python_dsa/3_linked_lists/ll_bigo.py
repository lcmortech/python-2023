# Append - O(1) - the penultimate node and tail append to the last node 
# Prepend - O(1) - the first node and tail attach to the first node in the ll, while each following node points to next
# Remove - O(n) - we change the old node's pointer to a new node
# Search - O(n) - in order to find a node, we have to go through each node
